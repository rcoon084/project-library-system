## ðŸŽ‡Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is built using **.NET** and **C\#**, with a strong emphasis on professional software design patterns.

### Architectural Design

The application is built upon a clean, 3-tier architecture that separates concerns and follows all five **SOLID** principles:

1.  **UI Layer (`LibraryConsoleManager`)**: Responsible for all user interaction.
2.  **Business Logic Layer (`LibraryService`)**: Contains the core application rules and orchestrates actions.
3.  **Data Layer (`LibraryRepository`)**: Manages the in-memory data storage.

This decoupled design is achieved through **Dependency Inversion**, where high-level modules depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.
